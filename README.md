## Troubleshoot
The app now has a Troubleshoot section to restore the plist file, but if you want you can also use [this shortcut](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/4920/). (Please note this may not work due to the shortcut being designed for MacDirtyCow and not KFD)

The shortcut will "reset" the plist file to an initial state solving any kind of problem.

### How to use the shortcut
1. Simply start it and wait for a drop-down menu to appear. 
2. Then click on "View it in Quick View".
3. You should see some writing, if the file is empty restart the shortcut.

## Notes
- iOS 15/14/13 are **NOT** and will never be supported, as this is **NOT** a tweak.
If you have one of the above listed iOS versions, please stay away from it cause it can bootloop your device.

- I deleted the issue section because of meaningless spam of some users.

- I will keep you updated on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/aboutzeph) and on this readme about new features and bug fixes.
